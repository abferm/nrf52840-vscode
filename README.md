# Why?
I was frustrated with the setup process for the nrf sdk and tools, so I made this sample project to make setup simple and automate installation of the sdk and cli tools.

# Environment Setup
## Note, the setup scripts assume you are running this on a 64-bit debian/ubuntu based linux distribution
1. Install vscode, make, wget, git, tar, and unzip
2. Run `code ./` in this directory
3. Install extensions listed below
4. Click the "Setup" button in the status bar or run `make setup` from the command line


# VS Code extensions used
* [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
* [VsCode Action Buttons (optional)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seunlanlege.action-buttons)
